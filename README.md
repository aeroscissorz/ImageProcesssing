# Image Segmentation Algorithm for Receipt Detection in MATLAB

Welcome to the Image Segmentation Algorithm project! This MATLAB-based algorithm is designed to separate images of receipts from other image types using fundamental image processing techniques.

## Project Overview

This mini project explores the following key components:

1. **Image Import and Display:** Initial steps involve importing and displaying color and grayscale images.

2. **Image Manipulation Techniques:** Basic image manipulation methods are employed to enhance visual quality and prepare images for further processing.

3. **Binary Image Generation:** Thresholding techniques are used to create binary images, a crucial step in the segmentation process.

4. **Preprocessing and Postprocessing Techniques:** Elementary preprocessing and postprocessing methods are applied to refine image segmentation for improved accuracy.

5. **Metric Development:** A straightforward metric is developed to classify images, providing a foundation for basic image classification.

6. **Application to Image Files:** The algorithm is tested on a small set of image files, evaluating its performance in separating receipt images from others.

## Project Implications

- **Receipt Detection Capability:** The algorithm serves as a starting point for distinguishing receipt images, with potential applications in more advanced receipt recognition systems.

- **Educational Value:** This project can be used as a learning resource for those interested in exploring image processing in MATLAB, offering insights into fundamental techniques.
